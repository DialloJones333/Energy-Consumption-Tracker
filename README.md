# Home Energy Consumption Tracker

## Objective -

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that enables users to monitor, analyze, and manage their residential energy consumption. The application will provide tools for real-time tracking, historical data analysis, and personalized energy-saving recommendations.

## **Features -**

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Users can view their current energy consumption in real-time, allowing for immediate feedback and adjustments.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: The application offers comprehensive charts and graphs to visualize past consumption patterns, helping users identify trends and make informed decisions.
- **Energy Comparison Tools:** Users can compare their energy usage against historical data or average consumption metrics to gauge their performance.
- **Customizable Alerts and Notifications**: The system will notify users when their energy consumption exceeds set thresholds, helping to prevent excessive usage and unexpected high costs.
- **Energy-Saving Tips**: Based on the userâ€™s consumption habits, the application will provide tailored advice on how to reduce energy waste and improve efficiency.

## Technology Stack -

- **Backend**: Developed using Pythons Django framework, the backend will handle server-side routing, data management, API endpoints, and alert systems.
- **Frontend**: Built with React, the frontend will provide an interactive, responsive, and appealing user interface. It will utilize websockets for real-time data updates and integrate with various charting libraries for visualization.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL will be the database used due to it's robustness and scalability alongside a large and mature community.

## **Outcome -**

Upon completion, the application will offer a comprehensive platform for energy management that is both informative and actionable. It will not only facilitate a deeper understanding of energy consumption patterns but also promote sustainable living practices among users.
